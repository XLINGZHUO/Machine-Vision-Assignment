\section*{Grading Rubric - Information for Students}

Grading rubric that will broadly apply to assessing performance. That is, assessment exercises that are associated with a predominantly qualitative rather than quantitative character. If, for a particular exercise, there is substantial deviation from the scheme outlined below, I will let you know! Note: Be aware that if your “Quality of Presentation” is poor, it could impact scores assigned for the other two categories! (DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE)
